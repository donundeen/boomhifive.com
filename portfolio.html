            Hi! I get up to all sorts of trouble, but in a nutshell I do
            creative and help others do creative.
            <br /><br />
            I'm the Founding Manager of the
            <b
            ><a href="//library.georgetown.edu/makerhub"
            >Maker Hub at Georgetown University</a
            ></b
            >.<br />
            <br />
            I was the Founding and Senior Manager of the
            <b
            ><a
            href="//www.metmuseum.org/blogs/listing?facettype=tag&facetname=MediaLab"
            >MediaLab at the Metropolitan Museum of Art</a
            ></b
            >. In 2012 I was tasked with establishing a space for
            experimentation at the intersection of art, technology, and the
            museum experience. By working closely with NYC's creative
            technology community, the MediaLab developed a worldwide
            reputation for consistently delivering provocative, exciting, and
            valuable projects. <br /><br />
            Lessee, what else... I've traveled around the world, consulting
            with museums, universities, governments, and religious
            organizations on how to develop space for creativity and
            innovation. I advise entrepreneurs and students on project
            development. I serve as technical lead for cultural projects. I
            help multimedia artists develop new works. I create digital art
            systems and use them to perform my own compositions. I design and
            create art objects using digital fabrication and vintage tech.
            <br /><br />
            I like people, experiences, AND things.

        <div class="demonstrates"><strong>This project demonstrates</strong> my approach to human-centered design: finding the right questions, listening actively, investing stakeholders, and focusing on the best next step. It demonstrates my ability to consider the entire experience of a space, and make informed decisions to improve that experience.</div>
        <div class="item_description">
          <p class="design_question">“How do we promote a ‘Maker Mindset’ in a University without an engineering, architecture, design, or education program?”</p>
          <p>
            The Maker Hub is Georgetown University’s only makerspace open to all students, staff and faculty, in the University’s main library. Visitor projects may be course-related, entrepreneurial, or purely personal, and almost all supplies are free. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I was hired in August of 2016 to turn an empty room with a couple 3d printers into a functioning makerspace. I approached this as a human-centered design problem, focusing first on the experience we wanted our visitors to have. 
          </p>
          <p>

            The Georgetown community is primarily liberal arts focused, with a strong social justice component, and a large business school. Therefore we don’t have a large base of highly technical students to draw from.
          </p>
          <p>

            Through stakeholder meetings, leadership strategy sessions, and observation of interaction in the space, we identified some guiding principles:
            <ul>
              <li>Create an environment that people WANT to be in</li>
              <li>Low barrier to entry for non-technical and poorly resourced users</li>
              <li>Everyone deserves to feel welcome and wanted, from their first visit</li>
              <li>Create memories and capture stories</li>
              <li>Shorten the design-build-test-repeat iteration cycle</li>
              <li>The people that use the space are invested in its future</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            These principles guided our decisions about tool selection, the built environment, policies, staffing, and programming.
          </p>
          <p>

            <h3>Tool Selection</h3>
            We purchased fabrication systems that are easy to learn, inexpensive to repair, and have a low cost for consumables. This lowers the barrier to entry, shortens iteration cycles, and increases the number of successes visitors have during their first visit.
          </p>
          <p>


            <h3>The Built Environment</h3>
            <p class="design_question">“How do we design a room that encourages curiosity and community?”</p>
            The Maker Hub was designed to maximize available work surfaces in a small footprint,  while permitting multiple interaction types. To achieve this, we built disciplinary workstations (3D, Sewing, Woodshop, etc) around the perimeter of the space, with a long central table in the middle).  This allowed both for isolation and concentration in workstations, and socialization and cross-disciplinary work in the middle. Friends and memories are made in our central table when students share their work.
          </p>
          <p>

            We built an entry station with a custom ID card reader at the front door, on a long thin table that clearly delineated the “welcome zone,” where volunteers would greet visitors and establish the ground rules for use of the space. This ensures that every visitor who walks in the door is made to feel like they belong. 
          </p>
          <p>

            <h3>Staffing</h3>
            We established a volunteer program whereby students serve one 2-hour shift per week, and in return get expanded access to the space. Volunteers additionally receive special training on the tools, and participate in monthly all-staff meetings to generate new ideas for the space based on our experiences with our visitors. This volunteer community of 30-50 students per semester provides continual reinforcement of community values, a broad knowledge base of experience and skills to support sophisticated projects, and a network of advocates throughout the university. This supports our principles of lowering the barrier to entry, creating a welcoming environment, and building a community that is invested in the future of the Maker Hub.
          </p>
          <p>

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            To lower the barrier to entry and shorten the iteration cycle, we focused less on one-off workshops, and more on maximizing the one-on-one, drop-in learning experience between our visitors and our volunteers. Through the volunteer training program we ensure that there is usually someone on hand to help with any tool in the space. Visitors can drop in and immediately get help with a project. This is more scalable than scheduling a wide range of workshops. We did discover that there is an audience segment that is uncomfortable with this model, and we designed introductory workshops specifically to attract this group.
          </p>

          <div class="item_description">

            <p>
              In 2019 the Maker Hub received a donation of 150,000 fine art slides from Georgetown’s Art & Art History Department, which would otherwise have been discarded. These slides are available to Maker Hub users as a consumable resource. I’ve developed a variety of projects using these slides, including window displays, lampshades, portable projectors, and earrings. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My most successful project has been the laser-cut 35mm Art Slide Lamp, a hexagonal arrangement of 12 slides assembled around a low-wattage led bulb. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The structure is produced on the laser cutter from .25” Medium Density Fiberboard, and can be completely assembled without glue, in about 20 minutes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve sold several of these, and have an Etsy shop (https://www.etsy.com/shop/BoomHiFive). I typically curate collections of slides based on my experience at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but also build custom lamps on request.
